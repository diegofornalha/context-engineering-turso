## Example 2: Architectural Violation Detection

### User Request
"Check if our architecture follows clean architecture principles"

### Agent Response
```
🛡️ Prevention Guardian: Analyzing architectural patterns...

⚠️ Architectural Violations Detected:

1. **Layer Violation**: Controllers accessing database directly
   - File: controllers/userController.js:45
   - Issue: Direct SQL query instead of repository pattern
   - Severity: High

2. **Circular Dependency**: Services ↔ Utils
   - Files: services/auth.js ← → utils/crypto.js
   - Issue: Bidirectional dependency
   - Severity: Medium

3. **Missing Abstraction**: External API calls in business logic
   - File: services/payment.js:78-92
   - Issue: No interface/adapter pattern
   - Severity: Medium

🔧 SPARC Correction Plan:

[ARCHITECTURE]
- Implement Repository pattern for data access
- Break circular dependency with DI
- Add adapter layer for external APIs

[EXECUTION]
✅ Created: repositories/userRepository.js
✅ Refactored: controllers to use repository
✅ Created: adapters/paymentAdapter.js
✅ Added: Dependency injection container
✅ Generated: Architecture diagram

📊 Architecture Score: 45% → 89% (+44%)

📝 PRP Generated: "Clean Architecture Implementation Guide"

All violations have been corrected following clean architecture principles.

```
🛡️ Prevention Guardian: Detecting import anomalies...

🔍 Import Analysis Results:

❌ Critical Import Issues Found:

1. **Circular Dependency Chain**
   ```
   components/Dashboard.js → 
   services/analytics.js → 
   utils/formatter.js → 
   components/Dashboard.js
   ```
   Impact: Will cause runtime errors

   - Package: '@types/react' (TypeScript)
   - Not in package.json

3. **Deprecated Imports**
